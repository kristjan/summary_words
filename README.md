> Take the word EASY: Its first three letters — E, A and S — are the
> fifth, first, and nineteenth letters, respectively, in the alphabet.
> If you add 5 + 1 + 19, you get 25, which is the value of the
> alphabetical position of Y, the last letter of EASY.
>
> Can you think of a common five-letter word that works in the opposite
> way — in which the value of the alphabetical positions of its last
> four letters add up to the value of the alphabetical position of its
> first letter?
